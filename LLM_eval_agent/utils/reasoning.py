    """
    Extends a knowledge graph (KG) with inferred triples based on an ontology using OWL-RL reasoning.

    This function loads a target knowledge graph and an ontology, performs RDFS reasoning
    to infer new triples, and then filters the inferred graph to include only triples
    that are connected to the original nodes of the target KG. The resulting extended
    knowledge graph is saved as a new Turtle file.

    Args:
        targ_kg_path (Path): The path to the target knowledge graph file (e.g., "fiware.ttl").
        ontology_path (Path): The path to the ontology file (e.g., "Brick.ttl").
        output_filename (str, optional): The desired filename for the extended KG.
                                         If None, "_inferred.ttl" will be appended to the
                                         original target KG filename. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        Path: The path to the newly created extended knowledge graph file.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If either `targ_kg_path` or `ontology_path` does not exist.
        Exception: For other errors during graph parsing, reasoning, or serialization.
